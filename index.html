        <p> I first studied at Blackburn Language school to learn the basics of English before transfering to Balwyn North Primary where i spent my years as a primary school student. </p>
        <p>After finishing primary school, i went on to study at Balwyn High school where i graduated and is now studying at RMIT university for a bachelor of computer science.</p>
        <p>I began programming in year 8 and fell deeply in love with it ever since, I enjoy the challenges it brings as well as the satisfaction from solving said challenge</p>
        <p>I am also passionate about basketball, I started playing the sport at an young age and has been participating in competition all throughout my school years</p>
        <p>I've only recently stopped playing as much due to education and being an adult, but I wish to continue playing this great sport in some form for the rest of my life</p>
