        <p>I began programming in year 8 and fell deeply in love with it ever since, I enjoy the challenges it brings as well as the satisfaction i get from solving said challenges.</p>
        <p>I am also passionate about basketball, I started playing the sport at an young age and has been participating in competition all throughout my school years.</p>
        <p>I've only recently stopped playing as much due to my priority for education, but I wish to continue playing this great sport in some form for the rest of my life.</p>
